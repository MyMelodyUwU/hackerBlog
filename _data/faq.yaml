- q: What's with you and ramen?
  a: Ramen (whether it be real or instant) is an amazing food and abiramen just stuck as a username which I use in a lot of places. At that point, I decided that basing my entire personality on a bowl of food was a good idea. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- q: Are you aware that your ramen bowl looks a bit like a face?
  a: Uhhh... It's a feature, not a bug. :)

- q: Where's the top-secret CTF?
  a: There's a CTF hidden on a page somewhere in the www.abiram.me domain. Yes, the objective of the entire CTF is finding the CTF. Good luck!

- q: Why does this FAQ even exist? I bet no one's asking half of these.
  a: Don't expose my filler content like that. :(
