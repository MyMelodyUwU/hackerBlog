        <h1>CSE home computing setup</h1>
        <p>I wrote this up back during 20T1, but uploaded it to my website to hopefully help students that are new to
            CSE courses :)
            <br>Not all of this may be that helpful to you if the only CSE course you ever intend to take is COMP1511 -
            I
            suspect that most people will only need to set up VSCode to use SSH.<br><br>
            However if you are planning to do more COMP courses in the future (especially if you're doing a CSE degree
            or DataSci), you're inevitably
            going to be doing some of this eventually, and you'll be able to make use of your setup for the next few
            years!</p>
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
                <h5 class="card-title">Summary (clicking links will take you to the relevant section)</h5>
                I work across two of my own computers as well as the physical CSE computers. I use <a href="#vsc"
                    class="page-anchor">SSH via VSCode</a> if I want
                to work on the CSE machines, or I use the
                <a href="#wsl" class="page-anchor">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a> if I want to work on my local
                machine, especially if I'm on a bus or a
                train. I use a <a href="#git-github" class="page-anchor">GitHub repository</a> to sync code between my
                two devices and the CSE machine. I never need
                to
                enter passwords because I use <a href="#ssh-vsc" class="page-anchor">SSH-RSA</a> keys.
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id="vsc">Working on CSE machines over SSH with VSCode</h2>
        <p>This should be applicable to people across all operating systems. However, if you're on macOS, use
            <kbd>Cmd</kbd> instead of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.</p>
        <h4>Yeah, but what's this SSH thing you speak of?</h4>
        <p>In your first week of COMP1511, you may have been introduced to something called <a
                href="https://taggi.cse.unsw.edu.au/FAQ/Really_quick_guide_to_VLAB/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">VLAB</a>, which lets you connect to the School of CSE's computing servers over
            a visual interface (or 'GUI'). However, this can often feel less efficient, and may also be affected by
            compression and other latency issues if your <abbr
                title="I'm looking at you, Vodafone-4G-on-the-T1-Western-line.">internet connection isn't great</abbr>.
            Thankfully, some cool computer scientists created a protocol called SSH (short for Secure Shell), allowing
            you to communicate with remote computers over the terminal. Visual Studio Code, a really popular <abbr
                title="A text editor is a tool which allows you to edit the contents of file, such as a C file. You may have used gedit already!">text
                editor</abbr>, uses SSH to let you edit files on other computers, such as the CSE computers.</p>
        <h4>Sounds epic, how do I set it up?</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download and install Visual Studio Code.</strong> You can find a download <a target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here.</a> When prompted to
                do so during the install process, select to 'Add to PATH'. <strong>Restart your computer once you're
                    done.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Open the Extensions menu.</strong> You can access it using <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+X</kbd>.</li>
            <li><strong>Search for and install the Remote-SSH extension.</strong> While you're here, you should also
                install the <strong>C/C++</strong> extension by Microsoft. Once this is done, you might be prompted to
                reload the window.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Open the Remote-SSH menu.</strong> This can be done by clicking this button <img
                    src="img/ssh-icon.jpg" alt="SSH icon" /> in the bottom left. The menu should look like this:<br>
                <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/ssh-menu.jpg" alt="SSH menu" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Click Connect to Host.</strong> In the field that shows up, type in
                <code>z5555555@cse.unsw.edu.au</code>, using your zID instead. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. A new window will
                open. If asked to select a remote platform, select Linux. Enter your password when prompted. If your
                password is
                wrong, you will prompted to
                retry. Once you've done that, you should be connected successfully!
                <ul>
                    <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl+O</kbd> to open a file.</li>
                    <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl+`</kbd> (that's the key to the left of the number row) to open a terminal window.
                        You can run <code>ls</code> to see your files!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>We can save some time by adding this to our hosts list.</strong> Click the SSH icon in the
                bottom left again, click <strong></strong>Connect to Host, and this time, click Add New SSH Host.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter the following command: </strong><code>ssh z5555555@cse.unsw.edu.au -A</code>, replacing
                with your own zID again, and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. If prompted which configuration file to save to, use
                the first one.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>You should now see cse.unsw.edu.au on the Connect to Host menu.</strong> Now you don't have to
                type it in each time.
                <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/ssh-menu-2.jpg" alt="SSH menu" />
            </li>
            <li>If you want to avoid having to enter your password each time, scroll down to <a href="#ssh-vsc"
                    class="page-anchor">Using
                    SSH
                    keypairs</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Other cool VSCode things</h3>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/vscode.jpg" alt="My VSCode over SSH" />
        <h4>Editor rulers</h4>
        <p>The COMP1511 style guide requires you to make sure your lines of code aren't longer than 80 characters (and
            it's good
            practice to do so!). You can make VSCode show you a handy
            little ruler to make sure your lines aren't too long.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the settings.json file.</strong> To do this, press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and search for
                <strong>Open Settings (JSON).</strong> A file should open.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>We need to add to this file.</strong> You should see that the last line is a curly brace like
                this: <code>}</code>. What we want to do is add a comma to
                the second last line. Then, we create a new line after the comma, and paste this:
                <pre>"[c]" :{
    "editor.rulers" : [
        80
    ]
}</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Extensions</h4>
        <p>VSCode has heaps of themes and extensions. Some which I use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>C/C++ Snippets.</strong> Occasionally saves time with suggestions.</li>
            <li><strong>Material Icon Theme.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Dainty and Dainty - Material Theme.</strong> I personally use Dainty - Material Theme Ocean.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Discord Rich Presence.</strong> If you use Discord, then it'll update your currently playing
                status with details of what you're coding on.
                If one of your friends tries to drag you into a voice call, you can just open up VSCode and tell them
                that you're busy working :P</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember that neither VLAB or VNC work without a stable internet connection - if your train route has poor
            reception,
            and you like to code on the train, the next section might be for you.
        </p>
        <h2 id="wsl">Coding locally on your Windows computer with WSL</h2>
        <div class="alert alert-info">If you're not using Windows 10, or haven't updated Windows since 2018, this won't
            work.</div>
        <p>Windows 10 now supports running Linux distributions from within it. We can set this up so that we can easily
            use a lot of the Linux commands and scripting
            which are taught in CSE degrees, and easily compile and run our code without connecting to CSE computers,
            even if we have no internet connection. You don't need this if you only intend to connect to CSE computers.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open PowerShell.</strong> Type in PowerShell into Windows Search, right click on the result and
                click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. Select Yes if a prompt shows up.</li>
            <li><strong>Run the following command:</strong>
                <pre>Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux</pre>
                If you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Open the Microsoft Store.</strong> You can again do this using Windows Search.</li>
            <li><strong>Search for Ubuntu and install it.</strong> Ubuntu currently has the best support for WSL.</li>
            <li><strong>Once installed, open Ubuntu.</strong> You can do this by opening Search and typing in
                <code>bash</code>. Once you do this, a terminal should open!</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be guided through setting up an account.</strong> Make sure you remember what password
                you use.</li>
            <li><strong>We need to install a compiler.</strong> We'll be using gcc. You can use it just like dcc, but
                you'll get less helpful error messages. To install, run the following command:
                <pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential</pre>
            </li>
            Enter your password when prompted.
            <li><strong>Run the following command to make sure everything is up to date.</strong>
                <pre>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You should now be able to use the text based Linux commands you learn during the course, replacing dcc with
            gcc. (Note: If you've learnt about <code>dcc --leak-check</code>, it won't work with gcc.)<br>
            If you use VSCode, you can use <code>code [filename]</code> to open a file. If you use Vim, Vim will work as
            normal. However, gedit won't work. Google 'wsl x server' if you're really desperate to use it.</p>
        <h4>Attempting to install dcc</h4>
        <p>Your mileage may vary, but you can install dcc locally! Run the following commands:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><code>curl -L https://github.com/COMP1511UNSW/dcc/releases/download/2.6.4/dcc_2.6.4_all.deb -o
                    /tmp/dcc_2.6.4_all.deb</code><br>curl is
                a utility in Linux to download files from the internet. You may also see wget sometimes, which is very
                similar.
            </li>
            <li><code>sudo apt install /tmp/dcc_2.6.4_all.deb</code><br>This installs the package we just downloaded.
            </li>
            <p>Now, try compiling and running a program. If this doesn't work, run the command<br>
                <code>sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope;echo 1
                    >/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory"</code>,
                but only do this <strong>if you really need to.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Note that you should still follow the steps to install build-essential from earlier because it has a lot
                of other useful
                tools.
            </p>
        </ol>

        </ol>
        <h2 id="git-github">Setting up Git and GitHub</h2>
        Git is a really useful tool which allows you backup your code, revert to older versions, keep track of changes,
        update and pull your code from multiple devices,
        and provides several tools to allow you to work collaboratively. This is called version control.
        <h3>Signing up for GitHub</h3>
        <p><em>Every</em> developer has a GitHub account. GitHub provides servers for you to host your code, using Git.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sign up for GitHub <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        href="https://github.com/join">here</a>.</strong>
                This shouldn't take more than a minute</li>
            <li><strong>Get the GitHub Education Pack!</strong> GitHub Education is really handy. Students
                can get GitHub Pro, as well as heaps of other useful tools for free</strong>.
                Visit <a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">education.github.com</a> to sign up!</li>
            <li><strong>Follow someone on GitHub for the first time!</strong> You can score bonus points by <abbr
                    title="Obviously me creating this website was just to get GitHub followers :P">following me</abbr>
                <a href="https://github.com/abiramen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> :)</li>
            <li><strong>Create your first repository <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong> Think of a
                repository (or repo for short) as somewhere you store all your code for a project. Perhaps call your
                repo hello-world.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: If you're ever using GitHub for coursework, make sure that you make your repo private to prevent
            plagiarism.</p>
        <h3>Installing Git</h3>
        <p>If you're working on VLAB, or with the CSE machines over SSH, Git is already installed on these machines!
            Otherwise, you'll need to install Git.</p>
        <h5>For Ubuntu/Debian (including WSL):</h5>
        Run <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> from your terminal.
        <h5>For Windows and macOS:</h5>
        <p>Download Git from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>, and follow the
            instructions to install.</p>
        <h4>Setting up Git on each machine</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Telling Git your name. </strong>Run <code>git config --global user.name "yourusername"</code> -
                I
                usually just use my GitHub username here.</li>
            <li><strong>Telling Git your email. </strong>Run <code>git config --global user.email
                    "name@example.com"</code> - I usually use the private GitHub email ending with
                @users.noreply.github.com,
                which can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="https://github.com/settings/emails">here</a> under 'Keep email addresses
                private'.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making use of our new repo</h3>
        <p>Now, we want to make use of our repo, and push code to it.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Create a folder </strong> called HelloWorld somewhere on your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Open a terminal</strong> and use <code>cd</code> until you're in your new folder.</li>
            <li><strong>Initialise a <em>local</em> repository</strong> using the command <code>git init</code>. This
                means you've set up a repository within your own computer, which tracks changes.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make a hello_world.c file in the folder.</strong>
                Here's some code for you to steal.
                <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void) {
    printf("Hello world!");
    return 0;
}
</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Run <code>git add hello_world.c</code>.</strong> This tells git that you want changes to the
                file to be
                included in the next update. If you ever have multiple files that you want to update, use
                <code>git add --all</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Run <code>git commit -m "Initialise repo"</code>.</strong> This keeps track of the update,
                noting what changes you've made, and stores it on the <em>local copy of the repository</em>. Your commit
                message should always describe the changes you've made (in present tense!).</li>
            <li><strong>Now, we want to sync our local repository with our remote repository on GitHub.</strong> The
                first time we do this, we have to tell git where our remote repository is. We do this with
                <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git</code></li>
            <li><strong>We can finally push the change to our remote repository.</strong> Use <code>git push origin
                    master</code>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You should now see your hello_world.c file at https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name!<br> You should
            always commit and push your code whenever you've
            made a notable change, so that you can revert your code if you ever have problems later on. Note that
            git will
            ask for your GitHub password each time you push. We can avoid this by <a href="#ssh-git"
                class="page-anchor">setting up an SSH
                keypair</a>, which you
            can scroll down to read about.</p>
        <h3>Using git to work across multiple computers</h3>
        <p>We can make a copy of our hello-world repository on another computer using
            <code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git</code>. This sets up a new local
            repository with the contents
            from the remote repository. Now, we can work on our code on this new computer, and use git add, commit and
            push
            to update our GitHub repository just like before. Now, when we return to our
            original computer, we run
            <code>git pull</code> to fetch updates from the remote repository. as soon as we start. This is <strong>very
                important</strong> to do
            - if you don't, and realise too late, you'll have to deal with resolving what's called a merge conflict.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">These instructions are written for Windows 10, macOS and Linux.</div>
        <p>Following these instructions will mean you won't be asked for a password each time you open an SSH window,
            but will still keep your connection secure.
        </p>
        <h4>Part 1: Generate a keypair</h4>
        <h5>Windows</h5>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the Windows Command Prompt.</strong> You can do this by entering cmd in Search.</li>
            <li><strong>Generate a keypair.</strong> Use the command <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be asked where you want to save the key.</strong> Leave this blank, and press
                <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be asked to set a password.</strong> Setting a password would defeat the purpose of
                generating
                the keypair.
                Leave this blank, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again. Do the same when you are asked to confirm it.</li>
            <li><strong>Using the same Command Prompt as before</strong>, enter the command
                <code>code %userprofile%/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. This should open up a file in VSCode, starting with
                ssh-rsa and followed
                by a <abbr title="This actually represents extremely large number, which is used to form a mathematical lock. This is called RSA encryption,
                and you can learn more about it in MATH3411.">long
                    mess of characters</abbr>. Use <kbd>Ctrl+A Ctrl+C</kbd> to copy the entire contents of this file.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Linux/macOS</h5>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the Terminal.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Generate a keypair.</strong> Use the command <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be asked where you want to save the key.</strong> Leave this blank, and press
                <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be asked to set a password.</strong> Setting a password would defeat the purpose of
                generating
                the keypair.
                Leave this blank, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again. Do the same when you are asked to confirm it.</li>
            <li><strong>In your Terminal</strong>, enter the command
                <code>code ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. This should open up a file in VSCode, starting with
                ssh-rsa and followed
                by a <abbr title="This actually represents extremely large number, which is used to form a mathematical lock. This is called RSA encryption,
                and you can learn more about it in MATH3411.">long
                    mess of characters</abbr>. Don't close this file. Use <kbd>Ctrl+A Ctrl+C</kbd> when you need to copy
                the entire contents of this file in later steps.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p>Your computer has now generated two files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. The id_rsa.pub file is what's called a
            public
            key, while
            id_rsa is a private key. <strong>Never share (or even open) your private key.</strong> It's called a private
            key for a reason :P
        </p>
        <h4>Part 2: Using the keypair for CSE machines</h4>
        Now, we need to tell the CSE computer that your computer is trustworthy, and you are who you claim to be. To do
        this, we need to give the CSE computer the public key you just generated. If you're on Linux/macOS, this should
        be pretty easy, but if you're on Windows, there's a few more steps.
        <h5>Windows</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Using your existing SSH or VLAB connection, open a terminal on the CSE computers. <abbr
                    title="Technically multiple commands, which I've condensed for you. The purpose of these commands is to set the right file permissions.">Run
                    the following
                    command.</abbr>
                <pre>mkdir ~/.ssh;chmod 700 ~/.ssh;touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys;chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys;code ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>A window for a file called authorized_keys should open in VSCode.</strong> Paste your public key
                from earlier into this file, and save.</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Linux/macOS</h5>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the Terminal.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Run the following command:</strong> <code>ssh-copy-id z5555555@cse.unsw.edu.au</code>, replacing
                with your own zID.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter your password.</strong> You'll be asked for your CSE password one last time, for the key
                to be copied over.</li>
        </ol>
        Voila! You had it a bit easier here.
        <h4>Part 3: Telling VSCode on your computer to use your new keys</h4>
        <ol>

            <li><strong>On your local machine, open the SSH menu in VSCode.</strong> Click <img src="img/ssh-icon.jpg"
                    alt="SSH icon" />, then <strong>Open Configuration File</strong>, and select the first option. You
                should see something like this:<br>
                <pre>
Host cse.unsw.edu.au
    HostName cse.unsw.edu.au
    User z5555555
    ForwardAgent yes
</pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>We need to tell the SSH connection to use our private key.</strong> Add the following line to
                your config file, after the line with 'User' on it. Make sure to indent it so that it's in line with the
                others.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Make sure to enter your username. If you don't know it, it's the part
                    after <code>C:/Users/</code> when you open cmd.
                    <pre>IdentityFile C:/Users/[YOURUSERNAME]/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Linux/macOS</strong>
                    <pre>IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Once you've done this, you should be able to open Remote-SSH in VSCode without requiring a password.<br>If
            you need to add
            another public key to authorized_keys (for another computer), you can enter it on a new line.</p>
        <h2 id="ssh-git">Using SSH keypairs to push to GitHub</h2>
        <h3>Part 1: Generating a keypair</h3>
        <h4>Windows</h4>
        <p>If you've already generated a public key in the above section, you can reuse the same public key. If not, use
            the steps in Part 1 of the above
            section to generate a keypair.
        </p>
        <h4>VLAB/WSL/Linux/macOS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the Terminal.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Generate a keypair.</strong> Use the command <code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be asked where you want to save the key.</strong> Leave this blank, and press
                <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</li>
            <li><strong>You'll be asked to set a password.</strong> Setting a password would defeat the purpose of
                generating
                the keypair.
                Leave this blank, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again. Do the same when you are asked to confirm it.</li>
            <li><strong>In your Terminal</strong>, enter the command
                <code>code ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>. This should open up a file in VSCode, starting with
                ssh-rsa and followed
                by a <abbr title="This actually represents extremely large number, which is used to form a mathematical lock. This is called RSA encryption,
                and you can learn more about it in MATH3411.">long

            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Part 2: Adding your public key to GitHub</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the GitHub Key Settings page. </strong> <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://github.com/settings/ssh/">You can find it here.</a> Press Add SSH key.</li>
            <li><strong>Give the key a name to describe what computer it is from.</strong> This is so that you don't get
                mixed up if you add more computers.</li>
            <li><strong>Paste the public key you copied earlier.</strong> Press Add when you are done.</li>
        </ol>
        <img style="max-width:100%" src="img/ssh-github.jpg" alt="GitHub" />
        <h3>Part 3: Updating your local repositories</h3>
        <p>If you already have any local repositories, you need to update them to use the SSH Git path. To do this,
            <code>cd</code> to the directory, and enter
            <code>git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name</code>. <br>If you clone or set
            up any new repositories, you will also have
            to use the SSH address, i.e. <code>git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name</code>. If you're
            ever unsure as to the SSH path, you can check
            on GitHub.
